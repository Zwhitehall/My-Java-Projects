		//Method is an isolated block of code designed to perform a singular task
		
		//Parts of a Method:
		
		//1. Access identifier: public/private/protected
		//2. Static(is not called with individual object) vs. Non-static(needs to be called with individual object: 
		//Math.sqrt() <-Static method
		//input.nextInt() <-Static method
		//3. Return type-Data Type of the info returned from the Method (only returns 1 value from a method)
		//void-> nothing is returned 
		//4. Method name-How it's called(BE DESCRIPTIVE)
		//5. Parameter list-A list of variables with data types that the method needs to in order to perform its task
		//(Variables that are sent to the method and are accepted by the method)
		//Can have multiple Parameters
		
		//Methods can call Methods that can call Methods but cannot call itself
