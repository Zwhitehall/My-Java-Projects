	//Objects represent real world objects usually
	//An object is really a new data type
	//Objects can be described in terms of other objects
	//Primitive Data Types: int(Integers), doubles(Decimals/point numbers), booleans(true/false), char(characters +,1,a,A,@,')
	
	//Object Data Types: String objects(words/sequences of characters ex. String word="hello";), Scanner objects(represent eyes),
	//Random objects(lottery balls), Array objects(numbered list), 2-D Arrays(table)
	//State objects are things that describe an object. Are variables.
	//Variables that describe state are "instance variables" and "object variables"
	//-BankAccount has a name, a password, an amount, an account number
	//Behavior objects are things that describe an object in terms of actions it performs. Are methods.
	//-BankAccount can withdraw, can deposit, checkBalance
	
	//Person object
	//State: weight, height, eye color, name, age
	//Behavior: run, speak, jump, drink, eat
	
	//String Objects
	//Methods: a block of code that performs a task that we usually want to repeat
	//Name: usually descriptive of what the method does
	//Parameter list: info that a method needs to perform its task
	//Return type: Defines that data type of the info returned from the method
	//Strings are indexed starting at 0
	
	//String myWord= new Scanner(System.in);
	//String myWord= "Hello world@";
	
	//Creating objects-3 pieces
	//Constructors, setters, and getters (methods)
	//Constructor-every object MUST have this-this method creates the object
	//Constructor always MUST have the same name as the class
	//Can have the default constructor which makes all instance variables default values and/or
	//A constructor with values (sets instance variables upon creation)
	//Order of object code: instance variables, constructors, setters/getters, other object methods, static methods
	
	//instance variables and methods have an access identifier: private/public
	//Private-only accessible within class
	//Public-accessible to any class
